"""Answer accuracy on LongMemEval_S from the harness's retrieval dump.

Two measurements, one seam. `examples/longmemeval` ranks sessions and, with
`PACKSET_LME_DUMP` set, writes one JSON line a question with the session ids
each arm retrieved. This script hands the top sessions of one arm to a reader
model with the benchmark's own reading prompt, then asks a judge model the
benchmark's own type-specific question, and reports accuracy by type. The
reader and the judge are any OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint; the report
names them, because the number is theirs as much as the retriever's.

    export QA_BASE_URL=https://.../v1 QA_API_KEY=... QA_MODEL=...
    python3 scripts/longmemeval_qa.py longmemeval_s.json dump.jsonl --arm "sessions fused" --top 5

The prompts are LongMemEval's (doi:10.48550/arXiv.2410.10813), reproduced
from its evaluation code so a row here is read the way the paper's rows are.
An `oracle` arm hands the reader the labelled answer sessions: the ceiling
the retriever is measured against.
